BASIC EXPLANATION

Many options work with alternative files that need to be renamed. 
	You need to rename the original file first, to something like "FilenameOLD.res"
	Then you need to rename the alt file to the orginal name, removing the " - ALTNAME" part. 
	Make sure that there are no spaces left!

These alternative files are located in resource/ui unless stated otherwise.
	Example: "BaseChat.res" to "BaseChatOLD.res and then "BaseChat - MIDDLE.res" to "BaseChat.res"


Some other options are located in /Custom Options/ (in the folder you downloaded)
They are override files, you can copy them directly over your existing hud files.
Separate info files are included for these options. Look at them before you apply those options.

HP OPTIONS

	You can enable the HP Cross or the Pulse Cross using the alt files for "HudPlayerHealth.res"
		There's also an optional team-colored cross for the blank versions.
		The Pulse option is not available for the White Box Version.
	
	You can enable the line effect with the "LINE - " alternative animation file in /scripts/.
	Navigate to your scripts folder /custom/yourfoldername/scripts and delete or rename the original hudanimations file. 
	Then you will have to remove the "LINE_" part from the alternative file. 
		This is the default effect for the White Box Version.

PULSING SHADOWS instead of pulsing numbers (Ammo/HP) for the box-less versions:

Big thanks to fog for letting me use his crosshairs! http://i.imgur.com/vJsoF2g.png

	To enable them go into /scripts/hudlayout.res.
	There you'll have to change visible to "1" under "fog's crosshair".
	You can find more instructions there as well.
	These crosshairs flash red on hit, which can be customized/disabled.

Normal CROSSHAIRS

Activate the crosshair by going to your scripts folder and then hudlayout.

Change visible from 0 to 1.

	If the crosshair isn’t centralized do the following:

	1. Go to your scripts folder and then hudlayout.
	2. Change the xpos and ypos values. (xpos is for horizontal and ypos is for vertical).
	3. Start TF2 and see if it’s centralized.
	4. If not, Alt+TAB and try another value. 
	Go back into the game and type hud_reloadscheme in console.
	5. Do this until you’re happy.

	If you want to change the crosshair size go to your resource folder and then ClientScheme. 
	Change the tall value to whatever you like.
	
	If you want to change the colour go to your scripts folder and then hudlayout. 
	Change the fgcolor to the colour you want. 
	If you don't know how to customize colors go to the clientscheme file in /resource/.
	You can find information there.
	Example: "fgcolor"  "255 0 0 255" would make the crosshair red.

	(If the crosshairs isn’t centralized then you sometimes have to change “wide” and “tall” too, not just “xpos” and “ypos”)
	
	(Some CrossHairs are combinations, you need to activate more than one)
