Merge this resource folder with your resource folder in / team fortress 2 / tf / custom / <yourfoldername> /.

These menus may break when TF2 gets updated and they may cause crashes. 
You can either reinstall the HUD without these menu files or copy them over again and then undoing the action (CTRL + Z), effectively removing all the problematic files.

This is the reason why they are not included by default, so that the HUD is more likely to be usable after TF2 updates.

The bonus files contains more custom files. 
They don't affect normal play (they include stuff like the store content).
This is why I did not include them with the basic custom main menu, to reduce the risk of updates breaking that basic setup.
