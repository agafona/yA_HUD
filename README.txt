To DOWNLOAD the HUD press the "ZIP" button on top of the github page.

-----------------------------------------------------------

To INSTALL go to Steam / steamapps / common / team fortress 2 / tf / custom / . 
There you will want to create a folder with a random name (you can call it "hud" for example)
Then copy the resource and the scripts folder from the HUD version that you want to use into that newly created folder.

CUSTOM OPTIONS

Check the /Custom Options/ folder for various custom options, the rest can be found in your resource/ui or your scripts folder.

I created custom game menu files. They are drop in files. You can find the files & information on them in the /Game Menus/ folder

Instructions for COLORS, ALT files and CROSSHAIRS can be found in CUSTOMIZATION.txt
