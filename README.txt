To DOWNLOAD the HUD press the "ZIP" button on top of the github page.

-----------------------------------------------------------

To INSTALL go to Steam / steamapps / common / team fortress 2 / tf / custom / . 
There you will want to create a folder with a random name (you can call it "hud" for example)
Then copy the resource and the scripts folder from the HUD version that you want to use into that newly created folder.

Instructions for HUD crosshairs can be found at the end of the CUSTOMIZATION.txt

-----------------------------------------------------------

Most options for customizing are done via alternative files in resource/ui. 

	Rename the original file to something like "filenameOLD.res" and removed the " - ALTNAME" part from the option.
	Make sure that there are no spaces left.

	More instructions for COLORS, ALT files and CROSSHAIRS can be found in CUSTOMIZATION.txt

Here's a list of custom options:

	- adding HP cross, pulsing background or underline
	- changing colors
	- alternative medic charge meter
	- small charge % under crosshair
	- various scoreboards (http://imgur.com/a/x3vTd)

	- class image at the bottom of the screen
	- flash shadow instead of number for warning (goes well with HP pulse, http://i.imgur.com/xNpSB3r.jpg)
	- add spacing to killfeed
	- move the spectator HUD to the bottom
	- disable warning flashes
	- TargetIDs without boxes (looking at health and name of other players)

	- custom HUD crosshairs
	- HP cross on targetID (when you look at someone etc)
	- Chat position
	- Use a colored team menu in the style of the scoreboard/winpanel
	- Use a colored Main Menu
	- Use a movie-making HUD version (only deathnotice + dmg numbers)
