To DOWNLOAD the HUD press the "ZIP" button on top of the github page.

-----------------------------------------------------------

To INSTALL, 
go to Steam / steamapps / common / team fortress 2 / tf / custom / 
create a folder and name it, for example, hud / place resource and scripts in it. 

-----------------------------------------------------------

If you're using a 16:10 or 4:3 monitor:

1. Open the 4BY3 or 16BY10 folder from the folder that you've downloaded
2. Copy all the files(and replace the old ones) into resource/ui

This will fix the MainMenu for you aspect ratio and the scoreboard for 4:3.

Big thanks to fog for letting me use his crosshairs! http://i.imgur.com/vJsoF2g.png
To enable them go into /scripts/hudlayout.res.
There you'll have to change visible to "1" under "fog's crosshair".
You can find more instructions there as well.
These crosshairs flash red on hit, which can be customized/disabled.

You can also enable Garm3n's crosshairs in that file.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Most options for customizing are done via alternative files in resource/ui. 
Rename the original file to something like "filenameOLD.res" and removed the " - ALTNAME" part from the option.
Make sure that there are no spaces left.

-----------------------------------------------------------

More instructions for COLORS, ALT files and CROSSHAIRS can be found in CUSTOMIZATION.txt

Here's a list of custom options:

-changing colors
-adding HP cross or pulse
-alternative medic charge meter
-small charge % under crosshair
-various scoreboards http://imgur.com/a/x3vTd

-class indicator
-flash shadow instead of number for warning (goes well with HP pulse, http://i.imgur.com/xNpSB3r.jpg )
-add spacing to killfeed
-move the spectator HUD to the bottom
-disable warning flashes
-TargetIDs without boxes (looking at health and name of other players)

-custom HUD crosshairs
-HP cross on targetID (when you look at someone etc)
-Chat position
-use a colored team menu in the style of the scoreboard/winpanel
