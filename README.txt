To DOWNLOAD the HUD press the "ZIP" button on top of the github page.

-----------------------------------------------------------

To INSTALL go to Steam / steamapps / common / team fortress 2 / tf / custom / . 
There you will want to create a folder with a random name (you can call it "hud" for example)
Then copy the resource and the scripts folder from the yA_HUD folder into that newly created folder.
