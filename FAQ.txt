FAQ

----------------------------------------------------------------

Q:	How do you enable the spectator HUD?
A:	Tick "Use adv. spectator HUD" in the advanced options menu.

Q:	How do I get the default 16vs16 Scoreboard?
A:	Scoreboards toggle with hud_minmode. 
	If you want the game to launch with the 16vs16 scoreboard make sure that your game launches without minimnal HUD enabled.

Q:	My net_graph is clipping with the scoreboard. Help!
A:	That is not a question, damnit! You can use "net_graphpos (1-3)" to have the netgraph on the left side. 
	The command "net_graphproportionalfont 0" will make the text smaller for the netgraph.
	
Q:	Can you add <insert feature> to the HUD?
A:	Maybe. Open an issue on GitHub so that I can see track your suggestions. (github.com/whayay/yA_HUD/issues)

Q:	I've found a bug. How do I let you know?
A:	Same as above, use the GitHub issue tracker to let me know.

Q:	Can I use this on my Mac?
A:	Yes, but the fonts will be bugged a bit. I can't offer Mac support right now.

Q:	Is the version I have up to date?
A:	If you just downloaded, yes. GitHub will sync all the changes I make. 
	You can track the commit history to see what happened since you downloaded the HUD. 
	(https://github.com/whayay/yA_HUD/commits/master)
	You can download older versions there as well.
	
Q:	I used one of the custom options, but now everything is weird!
A:	Make sure that you renamed/removed the original file before replacing it with the alternative file.
	Look for any odd character in the replacement files (watch out for spaces or "-" being left over).
	Please double-check the instructions before contacting me.

Q:	How can I import HUD crosshairs?
A:	Check out Ray's guide: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/19762650/importingxhairstf2.jpg
	Or watch this video by Rays: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPH6On2F0Pw

Q:	I changed some colors in the clientscheme and nothing has changed!
A:	You need to restart the game for any changes to take effect. 
	Make sure that you didn't accidentally delete quotation marks.

Q: My health stays red even though I have full health! Is this a bug?
A: Yes, but it's on valve's end. You will experience this with pretty much every hud.
	You can use the command "hud_reloadscheme" to get rid of it.
	
Q: The vaccinator HUD is not showing the icons! Can you add those icons?
A: Their position is broken on valve's end. The same thing applies for the status effects, which is why they are missing from the center version with HP cross.
